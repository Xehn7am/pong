# The Pong project

This is a 2 players on the same keyboard Pong game.

Pong or should I say *Multi-Pong* or *Crazy-Pong* as there are **multiple balls**, **bonuses** and **maluses**.

A ball rebound increments your score. 
You win the game when 50 points are reached.

You can play right now at this address: http://inside.github.com/pong/
